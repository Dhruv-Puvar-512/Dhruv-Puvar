🌟 Projects
1. Semi-Supervised Segmentation on Cloudy Satellite Images
Tech Stack: Python, Tensorflow

Implemented semi-supervised learning techniques to improve cloud region detection via semantic segmentation.
Utilized clustering techniques in the decoder part of U-Net, enhancing cloud segmentation accuracy with limited labeled data.
2. iNoteBook
Tech Stack: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

Created a note-taking application that allows users to create, edit, and organize notes.
Features include the ability to search notes using keywords and user-friendly design for efficient information management.
<!-- ### 3. [Kidney Cancer Classification](https://github.com/Dhruv-Puvar-512/kidneyCancer) **Tech Stack**: Python, Keras - Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify kidney cancer from medical images like CT scans and MRI scans. - Achieved high accuracy in detecting and classifying kidney cancer tumors. -->
